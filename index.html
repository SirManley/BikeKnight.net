        <h1>Welcome to BikeKnight.net</h1>
        <p>There are two kinds of riders: those who want to understand how everything works and be able to fix it themselves, and those who just want to ride.
            If you find yourself more interested in riding than wrenching, you’ve come to the right place. As a motorcyclist and scooterist who falls firmly in the first camp, I take great pride in helping other riders get back on the road so they can enjoy their hobby.
            When you’ve got a motorcycle or scooter that isn’t running right (or at all), contact me to find out what it might take to get you back in the saddle. With more than 15 years of experience, The Bike Knight can help you get back to what you love—RIDING!
